# WSU - Programming Techniques Major Assignment.

This is the code for my Programming techniques class.

We were tasked with building a library management system.

We were required to:
- Read and write data from a .txt file that was comma seperated (Books, Members, Loans)
- Add new books to system
- Add new members to system
- Search for books
- Borrow books
- Return book
- Create overdue book report
- Ignore incorrectly formatted data
- Validate inputted data

**LibraryProgram18882559.java** is the main file that handles all operations
**Book.java, Loan.java, Member.java** are files that contain a class for each model as well as help functions.
