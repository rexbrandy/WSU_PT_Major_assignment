# Library Management System

This Java-based library management system provides a simple command-line interface for managing books, members, and loans in a library. It allows the addition of new books and members, borrowing and returning books, and generating reports on overdue loans. The system reads and writes data to/from CSV files, ensuring persistent storage across sessions. This repository contains the code and associated files for the assignments and projects completed as part of the COMP 2015 - Programming Techniques course at [Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/).
